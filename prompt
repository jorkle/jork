I am working to create a command line application using Go and Bubbletea. 
 
 Features:                                                          
 - Four modes:
 - Send text, receive voice audio
 - send voice audio, receive text                           
 - send text receive text              
 - send voice receive voice             

The AI you are explaining concepts to can have its "knowledge level" changed from "child", "high school student", "freshman university student in the field in question", "co worker in the field in question".
Depending on the current value for that setting the AI will pretend to only understand things at that level. This will force the user to break down complex ideas and concepts into a form that a person at that level can understand.
The program only needs to work on Linux/AMD64 devices. It shuld use the default microphone and speaker. It should use claude's anthropic api. 
Use the existing project structure under the current directory. Take advantaged of structured outputs for the API where possible to get JSON responses from claude's API. Use an openAI model to convert the text into audio for modes that require an audio response.
